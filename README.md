### General Information
This project used the GitHub API to access users basic information and a search input to create a card. The card consisted of the users name, their bio description, how many they are following and people following them, as well as links to their last 6 repositories.

### Takeaways
I furthered my understanding of accessing API's as well as using template literals. Thia was my first time using axios, and this project has made me add an axios course to my "to study" list.
